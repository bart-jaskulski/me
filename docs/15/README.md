# Executing commands within `less`

It was known to me, that `vim` can benefit from *filters*, but I've actually read some commands description in `less` and it brings multiple powerful features, like executing shell commands, etc.

Think of looking though `git blame` and executing `git show` with desired SHA. I cannot believe, I always exit `less` before, to span a new command, and repeat.
