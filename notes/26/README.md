# Removing commits from github

In case of leaking secrets in github, the only viable way of removing commit from web access is to
nuke the repository.

Removing commit with `git filter-repo` is the first thing to do, but it only removes it from
plainly available history, still dangling and waiting to be pruned by `git gc`. And github is known
to keep dangling commits for a long time[^1]. If you don't have a time to contact github support,
make repository private and/or remove it completely (you can always recreate it later, but you will
miss all stargazers, etc.)

```sh
git filter-repo --path path/to/remove1 --invert-paths
git push --force --verbose --dry-run
git push --force
```
